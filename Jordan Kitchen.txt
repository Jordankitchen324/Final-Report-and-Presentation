      Jordan Kitchen - I worked on the code for the countries Italy, France, and Turkey as well as trying to form a comments page. I created all power points for presentations. For the countries given and recipes referenced I placed all that was need into the code. The comments page was very difficult I got help from multiple classmates and out side sources but still could not figure it out.  We have decided as a group to make it a future development. Here is some code use for the Pepperoni Pizza page,<!DOCTYPE html><html>   <head>      <title>    Pepperoni Pizza       </title>       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Code4Recipes.css">   </head>   <body>              <div class="content">       <p>Pepperoni Pizza</p>       <img src="PepperoniPizza.jpg" alt = "Pepperoni Pizza" style = "width: 100%"/>                  <p>Ingredients</p>       <ul>           <li>1 cup tomato-and-basil pasta sauce</li>           <li>1 (10-oz.) package prebaked whole wheat thin Italian pizza crust</li>           <li>1/4 cup turkey pepperoni slices (about 24)</li>           <li>1 1/2 cups (6 oz.) part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>                  As seen on the website under Italy, the Pepperoni Pizza page came out very simple and easy to read. A user can select Italy and then select Pizza and arrive at the page I formed. I spoke with our client and a comment page was not important because our client wanted just to show her costumers and user the preferred way to make it. For small reports to the class or to nelson I created the Power point to show.
