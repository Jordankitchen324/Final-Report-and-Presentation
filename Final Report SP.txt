Our instructions were to create a website that showed instructions of various meals from different countries. A huge problem with today’s recipe websites is all the ads and promotions when a user first opens a website they are flooded with unnecessary information. We were told to make the website simple and easy to use, so that users can get the information they need and form the dish they want.                   As a team we created a strict schedule to have all the website complete for our customer Rosalyn Jinkens. We divided evenly work for everyone on the team. We started in a group of four but one of the members failed to complete simple requirements we had as a team, therefore we had to let him go. Kendra and Jordan were in charge of the website. Heather was in charge of the database and any presentation along the way we met up as a team to construct them.Introduction       Thought the process of creating our Senior Project we ran into problems collectively and individually. We had problems with code in HTML, CSS, and SQL Server. Some of the problems were formatting pictures on the home page, creating a search bar, as well as forming a comment section (Something we will postpone for the future). HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL Server will allow us to create and hold our website called Cultural Experiences and Food      We chose this project because building a website that host recipes with an ethnic and cultural focus sounded very interesting to all of us. When Rosalyn Jinkens came to us with idea of a recipe website, she told us that she wanted a simple, friendly, and easy to use website. We took that as no advertisement, pop ups, and no crowded space. Our clients desire was to help and educate local friends and neighbors on recipes in foreign countries.       Kendra Francis - Worked on the website, I worked on the layout of the home page and making sure that everything on that page displayed how it was supposed to. I worked on getting some of the images for the home page and placing them in the correct position. I am also the one who connected all of the links to not only the images but also the text under each image. I also worked on the hero image and worked on the lighting of it so that it could show exactly like we wanted it to. I worked on the search bar and made sure that it allowed text to be entered into the field. I also did the layout code of both the country pages and also the pages that the recipes are on. We used her layout for all of the other recipes. I am also the one who put together all of the country pages as well as linking all of the pages together so that everything runs seamlessly. I made sure all of the links worked properly and that the website was up and running. I am also the one that did the CSS code that controls the webpages. I also did the code for the php that connects the website to the database to allow the search bar to be able to work. I used https://www.w3schools.com to get more information about how to build certain parts of the webpage. This includes help with the search bar and the hero image. I also got help from Dr. Chen with some parts of my html code and php to help with the search bar. I also worked on PowerPoint for the presentations that we did in class and to the engineering board. And making sure that we had a project to present to so the development of what we had along the way.      Jordan Kitchen - I worked on the code for the countries Italy, France, and Turkey as well as trying to form a comments page. I created all power points for presentations. For the countries given and recipes referenced I placed all that was need into the code. The comments page was very difficult I got help from multiple classmates and outside sources but still could not figure it out.  We have decided as a group to make it a future development. Here is some code use for the Pepperoni Pizza page,<!DOCTYPE html><html>   <head>      <title>    Pepperoni Pizza       </title>       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Code4Recipes.css">   </head>   <body>              <div class="content">       <p>Pepperoni Pizza</p>       <img src="PepperoniPizza.jpg" alt = "Pepperoni Pizza" style = "width: 100%"/>                  <p>Ingredients</p>       <ul>           <li>1 cup tomato-and-basil pasta sauce</li>           <li>1 (10-oz.) package prebaked whole wheat thin Italian pizza crust</li>           <li>1/4 cup turkey pepperoni slices (about 24)</li>           <li>1 1/2 cups (6 oz.) part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>                        As seen on the website under Italy, the Pepperoni Pizza page came out very simple and easy to read. A user can select Italy and then select Pizza and arrive at the page I formed. I spoke with our client and a comment page was not important because our client wanted just to show her costumers and user the preferred way to make it. For small reports to the class or to nelson I created the Power point to show.             Heather Olney - I made a xampp file for php insertion into the HTML code; Kendra took that file and with pair programming we linked the database to the search function. I worked on the database code(s) with some troubleshooting assistance from Google and a call to an outside resource for the php hurdle we hit when connecting the database built in SQL via Visual Studios 2017 to the website built in HTML via Notepad++ and Chrome. I utilized group meetings for communication, brainstorming, and troubleshooting any issues we were individually stuck on as a group. We each contributed a number of recipes that we each wanted to share on the site, focusing on countries’ traditional foods or a collection of breads found the world ‘round. The design phase involved all continuing members and all changes to the design and scope of the project was discussed and agreed upon by all continuing members as well. The minimalist design was a response to the over-crowded recipe sites that exist now. The hero-image at the top of our main page with the search function and text on top of the image were inspired by Epicurious.com.       Literature Review      Our recipe website, Cultural Experiences and Food is very unique compared to another recipe website. On like allrecipes.com and ebizmba.com we provided an easy and friendly way to find the exact ingredient and instructions to make a dish. allrecipes.com and ebizmba.com these two websites have enormous amount of advertisement and promotion. It becomes increasingly difficult for users to navigate through unwanted information. Epicurious.com is a similar website that we designed our website comparable to. Design Methodology and Design      The user would enter the information that they are looking for into the search bar that is provided from there the system would then search the database for the information. One the search is done on the database depending on what is being looked for the system would then return to the user the information that they need. Or nothing will display meaning that what they are looking for is not in the database. The system should also be able to read the user’s input and be able to understand what they are looking for so that the most accurate information would show up.      The database needs to be able to hold all of the recipes at are on the website. This includes the name of the recipes, what type of food it is, as well as the ingredients and the instructions. Also, in the database holds the source for all of the recipes. The information that is stored in the database needs to be searchable. It also needs to display the correct information when a query is executed.       The website is going to be hosted on the server that the customers wants. This is so that they have full control on what they could do with the website. we thought about hosting it on the universities server but since it is for an outside client we thought that this would not be the best option. The website will be able to be accessed via desktop, tablet, and phone. The links on the website are blue but once they are clicked on they turn purple so the user knows that the link has been visited. Both the words under the picture and the picture are links to the recipes. This is to make it easier for the user. The search bar is at the top of the website for easy access for the user.        At the moment since there isn’t a sign up for the website security isn’t needed. When any user is on the website they will be able to look up any recipes that we have available. On the site they can access all of the website pages. They would be able to access any of the countries on the website homepage and from there the user can explore different items from those countries.       The software can be used by many different people and they can access it anywhere they would like. Even if they were in another country the website would still be accessible to all. The system is always going to be up and running. So, availability in which any user can access the website does not depend on a certain time of the day or part of a year. The system is very efficient its response quickly when a user searches for an item. This is good because if there was a delay in the search then the user might think that there was something wrong. This would then make it so that they are not getting the results that they want and after that they might not use the website again.      The system as it is right now can be scaled to a better model. As in we can have it so that the users would have an account on the website. This can be so that they would be able to favorite items on the website that they liked and save them do try another time. This would also be helpful so that users can leave comments to themselves with how a dish turned out. It can help so that next time they make the dish they would know if they needed to add anything or change up part of the directions if it better fits them. The system is portable the user would be able to use it on any device that they have as long as there is an internet connection. We built into the code to have it so that the website scales to size on every screen.            The user would be able to look for different recipes on the website by clicking on any of the countries and finding something that they might like. We also have different food items on the homepage that they would be able to look at. The user also has the option to search an item that they might want and the results would tell them which country it is from and the name of the recipe. This gives the user a way to better find what they are looking for.        The website developer would upload the new recipes that they customer wants on to the website. they would also be the ones to place it in the correct area depending on what country it is from. They would also need to connect all the links in the proper place so that any user can easily navigate the website.      The database developer would need to enter the proper information into the database so that the new information is searchable. They would also need to enter each piece of information into the correct section of the database. This need to be done correctly because if the user was to search something and got back the wrong information it can ruin their experience. Each part of the actors to the system allows it to run smoothly.      On the home page at the top of our website we have every country that we host and each one has a list of different recipes. If a user was to click on any of those links it would bring them to the list of recipes for that specific country. On that page there is an image of the final result of that recipe and under it is the name of the dish. Both of those are link directly to the ingredients and instructions on what you need for the dish and how to make it. and on the top of that page is the same image of the dish. Back on the home page under the list of countries there is a hero image with a search bar in it that allow the user to look up items that they want to make.      Under those are images and text of certain dishes that are the stand outs at that point the owner of the site can change those whenever they want to.  Under three of those there are different types of noodle dishes that the user could make and next to that there is a quote. There are four images that are links to those foods. Those items are side by side next to each other but they do not have text under them. Under those are two more images with that brings the user to a list of different types of recipes. Everything on the page is link except for the hero image and the quote. At the very bottom of the page is the date that the webpage was last updated.      We used hypertext markup language to create all of the webpages that holds the recipes and the home page. We then used cascading style sheet to control certain elements on each of the webpages. We have one specifically for the home page, one for all of the different countries, and one that is for all of the recipe pages. We also used JavaScript to validate that what the user enters is actually a valid word. We have a Personal Home Page function that works with the search bar to look through the database to find the information that the user needs. Then we have the Structured Query Language database that is being used to hold all of the data for the website. with this we are using xampp so that we can use the php function to connect from the website to the database so that it can search it correctly. If we were not using this application there would be a lot more work for us in finding s way for the search bar to work correctly.      This is part of the home page with the links at the top of the page along with the hero image and the search bar. Under it is an image with is also a link to the recipes of that dish.        This is the one of the pages for the countries at the top of the home page with the name of the countries and the image of the recipe and the name of it. This repeats itself with all of the recipes for that specific country.       This page is for the recipe with the ingredients and the instructions for the user. And all of the recipe pages are in this simplified form. For these three images the user would use these pages if they were looking for something to cook. But the website developer would also use these pages in order to post new recipes to the correct pages.       This is a couple of the entries in our database which holds all the information about the recipes. That includes the name, what country it is from, its description, where we got the recipe from, a link to the source, the ingredients, and the instructions. This is used by the database developer and is an area in which the user would not have access to. Here the developer would be able to add entries or even take some out.            I chose to build the database in SQL using Visual Studio 2017 as my complier. Once I had created the recipe database, I initially attempted separate tables for the recipes and the ingredients, similar to recipe database coding I found during research, but this proved troublesome and created additional problems within the code. I then attempted to integrate the ingredients table contents into the recipe table but hit a wall with an “invalid column name” error. The solution to this problem was to rewrite the database creation code with more complex column names and all information contained within one single table. This was feasible within the project’s scope and fit the smaller, more personal nature of our site and, more importantly, it worked. The next hurdle was the php link between the SQL server and the website we built. The site wasn’t hosted yet and this led to some additional errors and confusion on my part. The group was involved in troubleshooting these hurdles; contributing their insight and utilizing their skills in html, php, and XAMPP. The reduced number of tables reduced the possible errors, simplifying the code and fixing the errors other troubleshooting attempts failed to.            The small scope of the client’s needs led our design at every step, with an emphasis on minimalism, and this extended to the database. A single table filled by manual input is sufficient for the little website we made, containing stripped down versions of the recipes we brought. Every recipe is saved with credit to the owner/website, with an eye for sharing within the client’s immediate social circle and not trying to replace recipe website giants like recipes.com and the food network. Further expansion would be at the client’s behest and does not lie within our current project scope. The database is linked to the search bar on our front page so that users could search the recipes in our database by ingredient. The search function is cursory and only searches our database of hand-picked recipes from various corners of the world.                                    Implementation    When I first attempted to build the database, I ran into “invalid column name” error and could not shake it, no matter the modifications to the database and its tables. I had initially started with 10 recipes, 2 tables, and simple names. I created a database with 2 tables but found the extra table unnecessary and built only one recipe table containing all of the desired information. By starting from scratch, I was able to avoid the naming errors with more complex and specific column and variable names to avoid any overlap with key words. At this point, all code has been SQL using Visual Studio 2017, the database built with all of the recipes we chose to include. When attempting to connect the database to our website, we found a snag with an additional layer needed: php. Using XAMPP and phpMyAdmin, I recreated the database by modifying my existing sql code.  Once built, saved, and tested the php database export file was created and inserted into the php code, which was inserted into Kendra’s HTML code.* Week 1: group created, project idea agreed upon* Weeks 2-3: individual recipes, round 1, collected by each member* Week 4: reexamined the layout and scope of the website, minimalist design agreed upon* Week 8: demonstrated both starting database and website, each in the initial stages, and approved of the directions going forward, added more countries and recipes for each group member to produce* Week 12: new database built with all recipes, website built (with scaffolding and aspects still to be decided or altered) with multiple pages and links already in place* Week 13: more design changes, presentation created, modified and given* Week 14: phpMyAdmin database built, group coding in php, html, and xampp to link the database to the search function on our website, the final report was sectioned out to each member according to each skill set* Week 15: finishing up the website, testing links and search queries of the database through the website’s search function, finalizing the final report, and creating the power point presentationConclusion and Future Work      We met majority of our expectations. We wanted to create a friendly, simple, and easy to use recipe website for our client. Rosalyn Jinkens was very pleased with the outcome. We learned that there is a great deal of trial and error creating database and the website. Our senior project was a group effort because of all of the time and responsibilities it takes to form a database and website. If we could do it differently we would have chosen each other faster as group members then picked out a client even faster because there was an amount of time that was taken to figuring it out. The way we went about creating the code for the database and website would not change differently we were very responsible and disciple when it came to our own personal deadlines.
